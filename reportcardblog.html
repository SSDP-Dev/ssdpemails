    <p style="font-family: 'open sans';line-height: 1.5; color: #636467;">Thank you for your tremendous support of our International Activities Fund! Last month, we kicked off the fund that will support our international programs year-round with a dedicated fundraiser, sharing the stories of students around the globe who
      have dedicated their lives to furthering sensible drug policies in their communities and countries. Our international network is expanding rapidly because, like you, young people around the world understand that the drug war must end, and it’s going
      to take a dedicated and supported student movement to make it happen. Thank you for supporting our work and sharing our stories -- we can’t wait to tell you more! Stay sensible, Your friends at SSDP </p>

  <ul style="font-family: 'open sans';line-height: 1.5; color: #636467;">
    <li>Congressional Republicans have blocked at least 34 marijuana and drug policy amendmendments from being considered on the House floor during this Congress. As Chairman of the House Rules Committee, Congressman Pete Sessions (R-TX) is largely responsible
      for blocking these amendments and newly proposed bills.
    </li>
    <li>A new study conducted by researchers from the University of California San Diego and Weill Cornell Medical College found state medical cannabis laws are associated with significant reductions in opioid prescriptions. "[If] all the states had legalized
      medical cannabis by 2014, Medicaid annual spending on opioid prescriptions would be reduced by 17.8 million dollars," the researchers projected. The study is being published in the journal Addiction.

    <li>NORML launched a <a href="http://blog.norml.org/2018/07/12/2018-congressional-letter-writing-campaign/">letter-writing campaign</a> to garner constitution support prior to the organization’s lobby day in D.C. July 23rd. You can still write your representatives
